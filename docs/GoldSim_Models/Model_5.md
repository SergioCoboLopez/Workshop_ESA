This model simulates bacterial growth based on metabolism and energy production. The model consists of three parts stored in their corresponding containers: Metabolism, Energy production, and Bacterial growth.

### Metabolism

The Metabolic container simulates three simplified metabolic processes: respiration, fermentation, and photosynthesis. Bacteria perform respiration and fermentation and photosynthesis is carried out by a generic
non-explicitly modeled primary producer (algae). How much respiration and fermentation is carried out is a function of eDAR (the ratio of glucose to O$$_2$$).
The respiration rate has been obtained from the estimations of O$$_2$$ consumption given by [Riedel et al, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00756-13). 
The rate of glucose consumption is obtained from stoichiometry of respiration. For simplicity, it was assumed that the fermentation rate is twice the respiration rate.
The photosynthetic rate has been obtained from the data that a gram of leaf metabolizes 44.14 ppm of CO$$_2$$ every minute. The Photosynthetic Active Ratiation (PAR) was obtained 
from [Ge et al, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-010-0368-6)

The technical details of this part of the model are discussed in the corresponding section:

### Energy production

It was assumed that a single respiration cycle yielded 26 ATP molecules, which convert to $$E_{resp}=8.229 meV$$ 
(see subsection [Energy Production](https://sergiocobolopez.github.io/Workshop_ESA/GoldSim_Models/Model_5%20-%20Metabolism.html) for the technical details ).
For simplicity, it was assumed that a cycle of fermentation yielded 13 ATP molecules, which convert $$E_{ferm}=4.114 meV$$ meV$$ (half of a respiration cycle).
The total respiration power was calculated as:

$$\begin{equation*}
W^{tot}_{resp} = \frac{M^{tot}_{resp}}{M^{B}_{resp}} E_{resp} \, .
\end{equation*}$$

Here, $$M^{tot}_{resp}$$ is the rate of biomass being processed by respiration (details will be discussed in [Metabolism](https://sergiocobolopez.github.io/Workshop_ESA/GoldSim_Models/Model_5%20-%20Metabolism.html) ), $$M^{B}_{resp}$$ is
the mass of a single respiration cycle, and $$E_{resp}$$ is the energy generated by a single respiration cycle. The equation assumes that the power generated by respiration is the number of respiration cycles per hour multiplied by the
energy generated by a single respiration cycle.

The total fermentation power was calculated in a similar way:

$$\begin{equation*}
W^{tot}_{ferm} = \frac{M^{tot}_{ferm}}{M^{B}_{ferm}} E_{ferm} \, .
\end{equation*}$$




### Bacterial growth

The bacterial growth was defined as:

$$\begin{equation*}
\frac{dB}{dt}= r \frac{W_{av}}{W_{tot}} B \, .
\end{equation*}$$

Here, $$r$$ is the bacterial growth rate, $$W_{av}$$ the available power from metabolism, $$W_{tot}$$ the total power requested from the community of bacteria at time $$t$$ $$B(t)$$.
