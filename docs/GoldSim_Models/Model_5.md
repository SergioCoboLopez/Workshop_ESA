## Model 5 - The Metabolic Machine

This model simulates bacterial growth based on metabolism and energy production. The model comprises
three parts stored in containers: Metabolism, Energy production, and Bacterial growth.

### Metabolism

This part of the model simulates three simplified metabolic processes: respiration, fermentation, and 
photosynthesis. Respiration and fermentation are carried out by bacteria and photosynthesis is implicitly
carried out by undetermined photosynthetic organisms. The metabolic container
