### eDAR and the switch

As a firs approximation, suppose that the only electron donors and acceptors in our system are glucose and oxygen and that the main metabolic pathway is cellular respiration.
 Then, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
   eDAR=6\frac{C_{6}H_{12}O_6}{O_2} \, ,
\end{equation}
$$

where the factor 6 accounts for the stoichiometry of cellular respiration.
