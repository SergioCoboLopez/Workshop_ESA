## Brief instructions on how to build this model

### Step 1 -  Introduce the pool (tank)

The pool is the only state variable here, and it is the most important element in a model.
Select a pool element, change its name, fix the units to liters (l) and flow units to liters per hour (l/hr). Selecting units is an important step, since GoldSim enforces unit consistency.

### Step 2 -  Set upper bound for tank

We introduce a data element
We are going to introduce a data element for this purpose. We could write the upper bound in the pool element, but this is considered a bad practice.

### Step 3 -  Hose flow rate

### Step 4 -  Inflow rate

### Step 5 - Connect function to inflow in pool

### Step 6 - Leakage rate

### Step 7 - Connect leakage to outflows in pool

### Step 8 - Result element

### Step 9 - Simulation settings

### Step 10 - Simulation settings
