## Model 1
This model has not been built by me. It is an example provided by GoldSim and can be found [here](https://www.goldsim.com/Courses/BasicGoldSim/Unit3/Lesson2/). However, it is a very good example to familiarize ourselves with GoldSim and how it works.

## Model 2
This is our version of a Lotka-Volterra system.

You can find and download this model in the repository at <https://github.com/SergioCoboLopez/Workshop_ESA/blob/main/GoldSim_Models/Bacterial_growth.gsm>

## Model 3
This one is our model for Lytic-Lysogenic interactions

You can find and download this model in the repository at <https://github.com/SergioCoboLopez/Workshop_ESA/tree/main/GoldSim_Models>
