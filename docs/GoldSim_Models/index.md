This section covers a series of models specific for the workshop at the [ESA Annual Meeting](https://esa.org/portland2023/) of 2023. 
Don't forget that GoldSim provides two excellent [free courses](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Customers/Education/Overview/) and other 
valuable [learning materials](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Customers/). Additionally, there is a thriving 
[community of users](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Customers/Community/) who can provide help.



The main elements that we are going to use in the next models are:

1. The pool

2. The input data element

3. The expression function element

4. The time history result

5. The container

6. The stochastic element
