This section covers a series of models specific for the workshop at the [ESA Annual Meeting](https://esa.org/portland2023/) of 2023. 
Remember that GoldSim offers two very good [free courses](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Customers/Education/Overview/) and other [learning resources](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Customers/). 
There is also an active [community of users](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Customers/Community/) who can provide help.

The main elements that we are going to use in the next models are:

1. The pool

2. The input data element

3. The expression function element

4. The time history result

5. The container

6. The stochastic element

7. The dashboard
