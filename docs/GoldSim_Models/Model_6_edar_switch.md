## eDAR and the switch

### eDAR
As a first approximation, suppose that the only electron donors and acceptors in our system are glucose and oxygen and that the main metabolic pathway is cellular respiration.
 Then, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
   eDAR=6\frac{C_{6}H_{12}O_6}{O_2} \, ,
\end{equation}
$$

where the factor 6 accounts for the stoichiometry of cellular respiration. Theoretically, eDAR can get any value between $$0$$ and $$\infty$$. However, that would not be consistent
with real ecological systems. According to [Silveira et al, 2019](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.49114), $$eDAR_{min}=0.24$$ and $$eDAR_{max}=1.36$$. For modeling purposes and to be more
agnostic, we define:

$$\begin{eqnarray*}
eDAR_{min}=0.1\\
eDAR_{max}=1.5 ,\ ,
\end{eqnarray*}	$$

as the minimum and maximum values of eDAR than can be found in any natural system than can sustain life. Low eDAR values correspond with extremely anaerobic environments (and metabolic pathways), while
high values correspond to catabolic environments. 

Our hypothesis is that the
