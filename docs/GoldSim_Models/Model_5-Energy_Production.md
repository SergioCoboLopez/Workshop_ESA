### Energy Production

This section discusses the technical details of this module.

It was assumed that a single respiration cycle yielded 26 ATP molecules, which convert to $$E_{resp}=8.229 meV$$ 

For simplicity, it was assumed that a cycle of fermentation yielded 13 ATP molecules, which convert $$E_{ferm}=4.114 meV$$ meV$$ (half of a respiration cycle).
The total respiration power was calculated as:

$$\begin{equation}
W^{tot}_{resp} = \frac{M^{tot}_{resp}}{M^{B}_{resp}} E_{resp} \, .
\label{eq:W_resp}
\end{equation}$$

Here, $$M^{tot}_{resp}$$ is the rate of biomass being processed by respiration (details will be discussed in [Metabolism](https://sergiocobolopez.github.io/Workshop_ESA/GoldSim_Models/Model_5-Metabolism.html) ), $$M^{B}_{resp}$$ is
the mass of a single respiration cycle, and $$E_{resp}$$ is the energy generated by a single respiration cycle. The equation assumes that the power generated by respiration is the number of respiration cycles per hour multiplied by the
energy generated by a single respiration cycle.

The total fermentation power was calculated in a similar way:

$$\begin{equation}
W^{tot}_{ferm} = \frac{M^{tot}_{ferm}}{M^{B}_{ferm}} E_{ferm} \, .
\label{eq:W_ferm}
\end{equation}$$

The respiration and fermentation power in Eq ~\ref{eq:W_resp} and Eq ~\ref{eq:W_ferm} are dumped into the Energy pool. Bacteria request power from this energy pool:

$$\begin{equation}
W_{req}=B(t) W_b V \, ,
\label{W_tot}
\end{equation}$$

where $$W^a_b=1.39 \cdot 10^{-13}$$ W is the active metabolic rate of E. Coli [DeLong et al, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1007783107). We assume that is the power required by a cell to reproduce. $$B(t)$$ is the bacterial 
concentration at time $$t$$, and $$V$$ is the volume of the system.

The available power given by the available resources in the system is given by the available energy in the corresponding pool. This is given by:

$$\begin{equation}
W_{av}= W^{tot}_{resp} + W^{tot}_{ferm} \, ,
\label{W_av}
\end{equation}$$
