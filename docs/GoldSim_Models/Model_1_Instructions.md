## Brief instructions on how to build this model

### Step 1 -  Introduce the pool (tank)

Select a pool element, change its name, fix the units to liters (l) and flow units to liters per
hour (l/hr). This is a particularly important step, since GoldSim enforeces unit consistency.

### Step 2 -  Set upper bound for tank

### Step 3 -  Hose flow rate

### Step 4 -  Inflow rate

### Step 5 - Connect function to inflow in pool

### Step 6 - Leakage rate

### Step 7 - Connect leakage to outflows in pool

### Step 8 - Result element

### Step 9 - Simulation settings

### Step 10 - Simulation settings
