## Brief instructions on how to build this model

### Step 1 -  Introduce the pool (tank)

Pools encode state variables in GoldSim. This type of variables are the most important ones.
Select a pool element, change its name, fix the units to liters (l) and flow units to liters per hour (l/hr). Selecting units is an important step, since GoldSim enforces unit consistency.

### Step 2 -  Set upper bound for tank

Introduce a data element and set the upper bound to 30000 liters. As in the previous case, remember to set the units and name the data element properly ('Tank_capacity').

Open the Tank element and set the upper bound to 'Tank_capacity', the name of the data element.

### Step 3 -  Hose flow rate

### Step 4 -  Inflow rate

### Step 5 - Connect function to inflow in pool

### Step 6 - Leakage rate

### Step 7 - Connect leakage to outflows in pool

### Step 8 - Result element

### Step 9 - Simulation settings

### Step 10 - Simulation settings
