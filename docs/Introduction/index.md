## What is GoldSim?

[GoldSim](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Home/) is a [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)  simulation software for dynamic and complex systems. 
It has a visual interface in which models look like diagrams. This makes the process of modeling easier than other programming languages.


## Why is it useful?

Ecological systems are highly dynamic and stochastic. GoldSim is specifically designed to model these types of systems. Its simple, intuitive interface simplifies modeling for users without a strong programming background.

## How can I install it?

GoldSim is proprietary software; you will need a [license](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Purchase/Licensing/) to use it. Also, GoldSim only runs on Windows operating systems. 
For more information, visit the GoldSim website at <https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Home/>.

We will have 25 student licenses generously provided by GoldSim for this workshop.
