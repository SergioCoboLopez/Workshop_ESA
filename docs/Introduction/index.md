# What is GoldSim?

[GoldSim](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Home/) is a [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)  simulation software for dynamic and complex systems. Its visual interface makes modeling simpler than other programming languages.

# Why is it useful?

Ecological systems are highly dynamic and stochastic. GoldSim is specifically designed to model these types of systems. Its simple, intuitive interface simplifies modeling for users without a strong programming background.

# What do I need to know to install it?

GoldSim is a proprietary software, and you will need a [license](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Purchase/Licensing/) to use it. Also, GoldSim only runs on Windows operating systems. For more information visit the GoldSim website at <https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Home/>
