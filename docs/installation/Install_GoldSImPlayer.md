## Installing GoldSim player

GoldSim player allows you to run certain files in GoldSim (player files) like the ones provided in the [repository](https://github.com/SergioCoboLopez/Workshop_ESA/tree/main/GoldSim_Models/Player_Files). You cannot edit or change models, but it can be a useful option if you want to get an intuition of how GoldSim works.

1. To install GoldSim player, go to the [download page](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Customers/Downloads/Player/)

5. Remember that GoldSim Player will only allow you to open Player files with the extension '.gsp'. To enable dashboard functionality, it's necessary to model player files. 
The [GoldSim Introduction Course](https://www.goldsim.com/Courses/BasicGoldSim/) provides guidance on how to create player files.
