# Instructions to install GoldSim

## Before installing
[GoldSim](https://www.goldsim.com/)  only works on Windows operating systems. Virtual machines are not generally recommended. GoldSim is a proprietary software and you will need a license to use it.

## License

If you are a student (undergrad, master's or Ph.D.) go to the [GoldSim Academic Application Form for Students](https://www.goldsim.com/Forms/StudentAcademic/). Read the instructions carefully and fill out the form to get a licence. If you are a postdoc, professor or other category, fill out the [GoldSim Academic Application Form for Instructors](https://www.goldsim.com/Forms/InstructorAcademic/). After that, GoldSim experts will get back to you and provide you the basic information to finish installing the software. If your license expires or you need support with installation, contact the [GoldSim Customer Service](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Customers/Support/).

## After installation

I would strongly recommend to follow the [Introduction to GoldSim course](https://www.goldsim.com/Courses/BasicGoldSim/) and download the zip file with the exercises and examples. In my experience, you should at the very least complete the first four lessons before starting to work on your own projects. Ideally, you should complete the first nine lessons.

Open the GoldSim density-dependent model and play around with it. If you canâ€™t find it, contact the GoldSim responsible person. What happens when you change the model's initial concentrations or growth rates? How does this model fit into your own project?
