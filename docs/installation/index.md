# Instructions to install GoldSim

## Before installing
GoldSim only works on Windows operating systems. Virtual machines are not generally recommended. GoldSim is a proprietary software and you will need a license to use it.

## License

Read the instructions carefully and fill out the form to get a licence. If you are a postdoc, professor or other category, fill out the [GoldSim Academic Application Form for Instructors](https://www.goldsim.com/Forms/InstructorAcademic/).
